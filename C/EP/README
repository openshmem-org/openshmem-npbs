This code implements the random-number generator described in the
NAS Parallel Benchmark document RNR Technical Report RNR-94-007.
The code is "embarrassingly" parallel in that no communication is
required for the generation of the random numbers itself. There is
no special requirement on the number of processors used for running
the benchmark.


This program is the C version transfrom NPB3.3.1/EP, under 
openshmem-npbs repo.
