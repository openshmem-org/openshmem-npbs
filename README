The NPB-SHMEM is the OpenSHMEM implementation of NAS parallel benchmarks.  We
have adopted NPB-MPI and ported them to OpenSHMEM to study the characteristics
of different implementations.

The NPB-MPI is the MPI implementation of NAS parallel benchmarks and is based
on NPB2.4 and NPB3.0-SER, the serial version. This implementation consists of
9 benchmarks of which seven are written in Fortran which are CG, BT, SP, LU,
MG, FT, EP and two are written in C, IS and DT.

-----------------
Current Status
-----------------

Our intention is to eventually provide C versions of all 9 NAS benchmarks
written using OpenSHMEM. To this end, we have creating two separate
directories, one for holding only the OpenSHMEM Fortran benchmarks and another
for holding the OpenSHMEM C benchmarks. Currently, the following benchmarks
are available in OpenSHMEM:

   Fortran: EP, MG, BT, SP
   C:       IS

More benchmarks, as well as optimized code for performance, will be made
available in forthcoming releases.

Compiling and Executing Benchmarks
-----------------------------------

1. Compilation

   Before compilation, one needs to check the configuration file
   config/NAS.samples/make.def.uhosh and copy it to config/make.def and modify
   the file if necessary.  Check also the suite.def file if one wants to make
   a suite. Then

       make <benchmark-name> NPROCS=<number> CLASS=<class> [SUBTYPE=<type>]

   where <benchmark-name>  is "bt", "cg", "ep", "ft", "is", "lu",
                              "mg", or "sp"
         <number>          is the number of processes
         <class>           is "S", "W", "A", "B", "C", or "D"

   Class D is not available for IS (Integer Sort).

   Example: make MG CLASS=C NPROCS=256

2. Execution

   The executable is named <benchmark-name>.<class>.<nprocs>, The executable
   is placed in the bin subdirectory. The method for running the OpenSHMEM
   program depends on your local system.

   An example run after allocating the nodes is as follows: Example:
        oshrun -n 256 ./bin/mg.C.256
