The NPB-SHMEM is the Openshmem implementation of NAS parallel benchmarks.
We have adopted NPB-MPI and ported them to Openshmem to study the 
characteristics of different implementations.

Each directory has the original MPI implementation retained for reference.
This file would be of extension .mpi in the same directory. Also in the 
Openshmem version the corresponding MPI calls are retained as comments.

The NPB-MPI is the MPI implementation of NAS parallel benchmarks and
is based on NPB2.4 and NPB3.0-SER, the serial version. This implementa-
tion consists of 9 benchmarks of which seven are written in Fortran which are
CG, BT, SP, LU, MG, FT, EP and two are written in C, IS and DT. 


1. Compilation

   Before compilation, one needs to check the configuration file
   'make.def' in the config directory and modify the file if necessary.  
   Check also the 'suite.def' file if one wants to make a suite.  Then

       make <benchmark-name> NPROCS=<number> CLASS=<class> [SUBTYPE=<type>]

   where <benchmark-name>  is "bt", "cg", "ep", "ft", "is", "lu",
                              "mg", or "sp"
         <number>          is the number of processes
         <class>           is "S", "W", "A", "B", "C", or "D"

   Class D is not available for IS (Integer Sort).

   Example: make IS CLASS=A NPROCS=4
   
2. Execution

   The executable is named <benchmark-name>.<class>.<nprocs>,
   The executable is placed in the bin subdirectory. The method for 
   running the MPI program depends on your local system.
  
   An example run after allocating the nodes is as follows: 
   Example: mpirun --loadbalance -np 8 ./bin/cg.S.8
